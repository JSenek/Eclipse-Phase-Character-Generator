				<name>Basic Biomods</name>
				<description>Almost universal in biomorphs, many habitats will not allow individuals to visit/immigrate if their biomorph does not possess these biomods in order to preserve public health. Basic biomods consists of a series of genetic tweaks, tailored virii, and bacteria that speed healing, greatly increase disease resistance, and impede aging. A morph with basic biomods heals twice as fast as an early 21st century human, gradually regrows lost body parts, is immune to all normal diseases (from cancer to the flu), and is largely immune to aging. In addition, the morph requires no more than 3-4 hours of sleep per night, is immune to ill-effects from longterm exposure to low or zero gravity, and does not naturally suffer from biological problems like depression, shock reactions after being injured, or allergies.</description>

				<name>Basic Mesh Inserts</name>
				<description>Mesh inserts are ubiquitous among modern morphs. This network of cybernetic brain implants is essential equipment for anyone who wants to stay connected and make full use of the wireless mesh. The interconnected components of this system include: Cranial computer: This computer serves as the hub for the character&apos;s personal area network and is home to their muse (p. 264). It has all of the functions of a smartphone and PDA, acting as a media player, meshbrowser, alarm clock/calendar, positioning and map system, address book, advanced calculator, file storage system, search engine, social networking client, messaging program, and note pad. It manages the user&apos;s augmented reality input and can run any software the character desires (see Software, p. 331). It also processes XP data, allowing the user to experience other people&apos;s recorded memories, and also allowing the user to share their own XP sensory input with others in real-time. Facial/image recognition and encryption software (p. 331) are included by default. Radio tranciever: This transceiver connects the user to the mesh and other characters/devices within range. It has an effective range of 20 kilometers in deep space or other locations far from radio interference and 1 kilometer in crowded habitats. Medical sensors: This array of implants monitors the user&apos;s medical status, including heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, temperature, neural activity, and much more. A sophisticated medical diagnostic system interprets the data and warns the user of any concerns or dangers. Using any of these functions is as easy as thinking.</description>

				<name>Cortical Stack</name>
				<description>A cortical stack is a tiny cyberware data storage unit protected within a synthdiamond case the size of a grape, implanted at the base of the skull where the brain stem and spinal cord connect. It contains a digital backup of that character&apos;s ego. Part nanoware, the implant maintains a network of nanobots that monitor synaptic connections and brain architecture, noting any changes and updating the ego backup in real time, right up to the moment of death. If the character dies, the cortical stack can be recovered and they may be restored from the backup (see Resleeving, p. 271). Cortical stacks do not have external or wireless access (for security), they must be surgically removed (see Retrieving a Cortical Stack, p. 268). Cortical stacks are extremely durable, requiring special effort to damage or destroy. They are commonly recovered from bodies that have otherwise been pulped or mangled. Cortical stacks are intentionally isolated from mesh inserts and other implants, as a security measure to prevent hacking or external tampering.</description>

				<name>Cyberbrain</name>
				<description>Cybernetic brains are where the ego (or controlling AI) resides in synthmorphs and pods. Modeled on biological brains, cyberbrains have a holistic architecture and serve as the command node and central processing point for sensory input and decision-making. Only one ego or AI may "inhabit" a cyberbrain at a time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts (p. 300) or a ghostrider module (p. 307) must be used. Since cyberbrains store memories digitally, they have the equivalent of mnemonic augmentation (p. 307). They also have a built-in puppet sock (p. 307) may be remote-controlled, though this option may be removed by those who value their security. Cyberbrains are vulnerable to brainhacking (p. 261) and other forms of electronic infiltration/attack. Cyberbrains come equipped with two or more pairs of external access jacks (p. 306), usually located at the base of the skull, which allow for direct wired connections</description>

				<description>The character has an innate sense of direction and distance using advanced inertial navigation. The character can arbitrarily define any point as "north" and keep track of which direction that is, as well as knowing approximately how far they have come. Characters with this augmentation can always retrace any route they have taken, only experiencing difficulty with three-dimensional routes lacking navigational markers (such as deep space or undersea; apply a -30 modifier). Since positioning inside habitats by anyone with basic mesh inserts is an automatic affair, only characters venturing to remote locations require this augmentation.</description>

In addition, their hearing is considerably more sensitive, allowing them to hear sounds as if they were five times closer than they are. A character with this augmentation can easily overhear even a softly spoken conversation at another table in a small restaurant.

				<name>Multiple Personalities</name>
				<description>The character&apos;s brain is intentionally partitioned to accommodate an extra personality. This multiplicity is not viewed as a disorder, but as a cognitive tool to help people deal with their hypercomplex environments. This extra personality can be an NPC run by the gamemaster, a separate character (in ego form only) made by the player, or the downloaded fork of another character. For all intents and purposes, the extra personality is treated as a separate ego (i.e., it may fork separately), except that both personalities are backed up in the same cortical stack and if downloaded they must be placed in separate morphs or in another morph with this implant. Only one ego may be in control of the morph at a time. The other resides in the background, still active, but not on a surface level. Each ego is completely aware of what the other is doing, thinking, etc. If for some reason the subsumed personality wants to come to the fore, but the other personality won&apos;t relinquish control, make an Opposed WIL × 3 Test. Each ego has its own Lucidity and Trauma Threshold, and they track stress and trauma separately. Any psi attacks or social/ mental influences only affect the personality at the fore. Having an extra ego in your head, working in the background, is helpful for multitasking. The character receives an extra Complex Action each turn that may only be used for mental or mesh actions.</description>

				<description>This adrenal gland enhancement supercharges the character&apos;s adrenal response to situations that invoke stress, pain, or strong emotions (fear, anger, lust, hate). When activated, the concentrated burst of norepinephrine accelerates heart rate and blood flow and burns carbohydrates. In game terms, this allows the character to ignore the -10 modifier from 1 wound and temporarily increases REF by +10 (also boosting REF-linked skills and Initiative). These modifiers apply until the character has calmed down (if the character also has endocrine control, p. 304, then adrenal boosts can be activated and deactivated at will, and the negated wounds are cumulative).</description>

Using this augmentation allows the user to lie and conceal their emotions in such as way as oo fool the keenest observer; apply a +30 modifier to Deception and Impersonation Tests. This modification does not affect methods of detecting lies and emotions that involve reading the character&apos;s neural state, including psi-gamma sleights. However, this augmentation damps out all emotional responses and so causes the character to be less persuasive in real- time personal interactions, imposing a -10 modifier to other Social skill tests like Persuasion.

This allows the character to completely control their appetite and emotions and to regulate pain. They receive a +30 modifier against the effects of hunger, fear, and any forms of emotional manipulation, such as the Drive Emotion sleight. This augmentation also allows character to lie with perfect conviction and to completely fool all methods of lie detection that do not rely on the target&apos;s neural output; apply a +20 modifier to Deception Tests. It also allows the character to remain awake for 48 hours without penalty, but after this time the character begins experiencing normal fatigue.

Physically, the morph&apos;s feet resemble a longer narrower hand or a human foot with finger (and thumb)-like toes. The character can walk normally but must wear specially designed shoes. However, this morph runs somewhat slower than a morph with unmodified feet (-1 meter per Action Turn). In addition, the morph&apos;s hips are slightly modified to allow greater mobility. In a properly constructed chair, or when floating in zero-G, the character can use both their hands and their feet to manipulate the same object. Most morphs used by characters who live in zero-G possess this augmentation.</description>

				<name>Emergency Farcaster</name>
				<description>Only characters with cortical stacks can possess this augmentation. The morph has an implanted quantum farcaster (p. 314) linked to a highly secure storage facility. The high cost of this implant also covers the cost of this storage. Using standard radio and quantum encryption, the farcaster broadcasts full backups of the character&apos;s ego (pulled from the cortical stack) once every 48 hours. At the gamemaster&apos;s discretion, the backup interval may be scheduled more or less frequently, keeping in mind that ego broadcasts are generally limited for security purposes and because they hog bandwidth. These broadcasts only work when the character is in radio contact with the storage facility and is typically only used inside a habitat to broadcast backups back to a nearby space ship. If the radio broadcasts are blocked or jammed, this device cannot make backups. In the event of a farcaster failure, this augmentation also includes a single-use emergency neutrino broadcaster (p. 314) as well. This broadcaster contains approximately 10 nanograms of antimatter stored in an orange-sized triply-redundant magnetic containment vessel. If the character is dying or urgently wishes to depart the morph, this tiny amount of antimatter is brought into contact with a similarly tiny amount of matter in a controlled fashion that generates a single brief and carefully coded neutrino pulse of the ego&apos;s most recent backup. However, the heat generated by this process literally cooks the entire morph, killing it and destroying all implants and electronics in or on it. This entire process takes less than 0.1 second and the broadcast can be received as long as the neutrino receiver is within 100 astronomical units of the character. Within the solar system, this implant effectively guarantees the character&apos;s backup. It is less useful on exoplanets where the character is out of neutrino range of their backup facility. The amount of antimatter carried by this implant is sufficiently small enough that it does not produce an explosion and will not damage any surrounding objects. Most habitats carefully scan all visitors to determine if they have this implant and if the amounts of antimatter involved are sufficiently low as not to pose a danger to the habitat and its inhabitants, and some ban this implant entirely.</description>

				<name>Mnemonic Augmentation</name>
				<description>A character with this augmentation and a cortical stack can access digital recordings of all of the sensory data they have experienced in XP format (and they may share these recordings with others). Mnemonic augmentation differs from the eidetic memory bioware because it allows characters to digitally share all of their sensory data with others. It also allows them to closely examine sensory data they did not initially look at. For example, If the character glanced at a note but did not read it, they can later use image enhancement software to enhance this image and in most cases actually read what the note said. Mnemonic augmentation allows the character to clearly hear all background noises, like a conversation at a nearby table that the character only initially heard a few words of. Using mnemonic augmentation to retrieve a specific piece of information is quite easy, but usually requires between 2 and 20 minutes of concentration.</description>

				<name>Multi-Tasking</name>
				<description>Only characters with cortical stacks can possess this augmentation. The character has an advanced computer installed in their brain that uses the data in the cortical stack to create several simultaneous short-term forks to handle various mental tasks. By design, this computer automatically reintegrates all of these forks into the character&apos;s core personality after a maximum of 4 hours, earlier if desired. This augmentation allows the character to both plan a speech and engage in intensive mesh-browsing while simultaneously fighting a gun battle or running from pursuit, since each of the forks operates independently. However, these forks can only perform purely mental or on-line interactions. This augmentation can produce a maximum of two forks at a time, giving the character an extra two Complex Actions on every Action Phase for mental or on-line actions. This implant cannot be used simultaneously with any other augmentation that allows for extra actions, or with the mental speed augmentation (p. 308).</description>

The puppeteer may directly "jam" the puppet or remote control it in the same way that robots and pods are teleoperated (p. 196). The puppeteer must either be ghost-riding the puppet (see the Ghostrider Module, p. 307) or have a direct communications link (via mesh, radio, laser, etc.).</description>

It feeds oxygen directly to the morph&apos;s blood stream, avoiding problems with pressure changes. Implanted sensors automatically cause the character to use the stored oxygen if they detect poisonous or insufficient atmosphere. Without vacuum sealing, the character can only survive in vacuum for 5 minutes, but remains conscious and active for the entire time, giving them far more time to find shelter or a vacsuit than characters without this implant. For every hour the character is in a breathable atmosphere, this implant recovers one hour of oxygen storage. The implant can be fully recharged within 15 minutes if the character is in a high-pressure mostly oxygen atmosphere.</description>

Characters can choose whether or not to deploy these nanobots. Each nanotoxin generator only produces a single variety of nanobots, with the most common types being ones designed to kill or incapacitate almost any living target or ones designed to destroy delicate machinery. Characters are immune to their own nanotoxins. Nanotoxins are highly restricted and many habitats will not allow anyone with this implant on board.</description>

			<augmentation>
				<name>Medichines</name>
				<description>This is the most common form of nanoware. These nanobots monitor the user&apos;s body at a cellular level and fix any problems that arise. Medichines eliminate most diseases, drugs, and toxins (but not nanodrugs or nanotoxins) before they can do more than minor harm to the host (see Drug Effects, p. 318). If desired, the user can temporarily override this protection to permit intoxication or other effects, but unless the character activates a second specially labeled override, medichines prevent the toxins from accumulating to lethal or permanently harmful levels. In this case, they can also be activated at a later point to reduce a drug or toxin&apos;s remaining duration by half. Medichines allow the character to ignore the effects of 1 wound. They also speed normal healing as noted under Biomorph Healing, p. 208. If the user suffers 5 or more wounds at once, or more than 6 wounds in an hour, the damage has exceeded the medichines&apos; ability to repair. In this case, the medichines place the character into a medical stasis, where their mind and body are perfectly preserved, but where the character cannot act in any way. Under these circumstances the medichines also send out a priority call for emergency services via the character&apos;s mesh inserts. Medichines for synthmorphs and bots consist of nanobots that monitor and repair the shell&apos;s integrity and internal system functions. Note that the synthmorph version of medichines allows the synthmorph to self-repair in the same manner by which a biomorph with medichines would naturally heal (p. 208).</description>

				<name>Mental Speed</name>
				<description>With this nanoware system, nanobots alter the character&apos;s neural architecture and augment the functioning of their neurons. The character can deliberately speed up their mind to think and also receive and process sensory information far faster than ordinary humans. Time seems to subjectively slow down for the character, allowing them to carefully plan their next action, even if they only have a split second to do so. With this system active, the character can discern things occurring too fast for a normal human to perceive, such as the individual frames of an old analog film or understanding sounds that were accelerated to many times their normal speed. The character can also read 10 times faster than normal and can track the paths of bullets and similar fast-moving objects with a successful Perception Test. When using this augmentation, the character gains two extra Complex Actions during each Action Phase that may only be used for mental actions. The character also receives a +30 Initiative bonus. The character thinks at normal speed whenever this nanoware is inactive. This nanoware is incompatible with any other augmentation that provides any form of extra actions, such as multi-tasking. This augmentation can be used as often as desired, but actively using it renders ordinary conversation and social interactions difficult and requires concentration to maintain.</description>

Though the swarm can "meld" together into a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a unit. Individual bugs, however, are quite capable of interfacing with electronics. Swarms cannot carry most gear or wear armor, and may not make strength-based SOM-linked skill tests. For combat purposes, use the same rules as given for nanoswarms, p. 328. Damage and wounds are reflected as damaged/ massacred bugs.

			<name>Neo-Avian</name>
			<type>Uplift</type>
			<description>Neo-avians include ravens, crows, and gray parrots uplifted to human-level intelligence. Their physical sizes are much larger than their non-uplifted cousins (to the size of a human child), with larger heads for their increased brain size. Numerous transgenic modifications have been made to their wings, allowing them to retain limited flight capabilities at 1 g, but giving them a more bat-like physiology so they can bend and fold better and adding primitive digits for basic tool manipulation. Their toes are also more articulated and now accompanied with an opposable thumb. Neo-avians have adapted well to microgravity environments, and are favored for their small size and reduced resource use.</description>

			<description>These uplifted octopi sleeves have proven quite useful in zero-gravity environments. They retain eight arms, their chameleon ability to change skin color, ink sacs, and a sharp beak. They also have increased brain mass and longevity, can breathe both air and water, and lack a skeletal structure so they can squeeze through tight spaces. Octomorphs typically crawl along in zero gravity using their arm suckers and expelling air for propulsion and can even walk on two of their arms in low gravity. Their eyes have been enhanced with color vision, provide a 360-degree field of vision, and rotationally adjust to keep the slit-shaped pupil aligned with ?up.? A transgenic vocal system allows them to speak.</description>

Novacrabs are ideal for hazardous work environments as well as vacworker, police, or bodyguard duties, given their ten 2-meter long legs, massive claws, and chitinous armor. They climb and handle microgravity well and can withstand a wide range of atmospheric pressure (and sudden pressure changes) from vacuum to deep sea. Novacrabs feature compound eyes (with human-equivalent image resolution), gills, dexterous manipulatory digits on their fifth set of limbs, and transgenic vocal cords.</description>

The manipulator claws on each arm/leg can be switched out with extendable mini-wheels for high-speed skating movement. A smaller pair of manipulator arms near the head allows for closer handling and tool use. In zero-g environments, arachnoids can retract their arms/legs and maneuver with vectored air thrusters.</description>

			<description>Designed for multipurpose functions, flexbots can transform their shells to suit a range of situations and tasks. Their core frame consists of a half-dozen interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multilegged walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others. Each module features its own sensor units and "bush robot" fractal-branching digits (capable of breaking into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbot control computer is also distributed between modules. Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics assembly, and so on.</description>

			<description>The reaper is a common combat bot, used in place of biomorph soldiers and typically operated via teleoperation or by autonomous AI. The reaper&apos;s core form is an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. It uses vector-thrust nozzles to maneuver in microgravity and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance. Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. The reaper&apos;s shell is made of smart materials, allowing these limbs and weapon mounts to extrude in any direction desired and even to change shape and length. In gravity environments, the reaper walks or hops on two or four of these limbs. Reapers are infamous due to numerous war XPs, and bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows if not get you arrested.</description>

			<description>The swarmanoid is not a single shell per se, but rather a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic microdrones. Each individual "bug" is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The controlling computer, cortical stack, and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can "meld" together into a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a unit. Individual bugs are quite capable of interfacing with electronics.</description>

				<name>Addiction (Minor)</name>
				<source>Ego</source>
				<description>Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character&apos;s physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Minor: A minor addiction is largely kept under control-it does not ruin the character&apos;s life, though it may create some difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have a problem. The character must indulge the addiction at least once a week, though they can go for longer without too much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose, they suffer a -10 modifier on all actions until they get their fix.</description>

				<name>Bad Luck</name>
				<source>Ego</source>
				<description>Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence, things seem to go wrong around the character. The gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal to the character&apos;s Moxie stat, which also refreshes at the same rate as the character&apos;s Moxie. Only the gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and the purpose is to use it against the character. In other words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that follows the character, the gamemaster can even use this bad Moxie against the character&apos;s friends and allies, when they are doing something with or related to the character, though this should be used sparingly. Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the character should remember that the player asked for it by purchasing this trait.</description>

				<source>Ego</source>
				<description>The character has suffered some type of neurological damage that simply cannot be cured. The affliction is now part of the character&apos;s ego and remains with them even when remorphing. This damage may have been inherited, it may have resulted from a poorly designed morph or implant, or it may have been inflicted by one of the TITAN nanoviruses that targeted neural systems during the Fall (p. 384). The gamemaster and player should agree on a specific disorder appropriate to their game. Some possibilities are: . Partial aphasia (difficulty communicating or using words) . Color blindness . Amusica (inability to make or understand music) . Synaesthesia . Logorrhoea (excessive use of words) . Loss of face recognition . Loss of depth perception (double range modifiers) . Repetitive behavior . Mood swings . The inability to shift attention quickly. The gamemaster may decide to inflict modifiers resulting from this affliction as appropriate.</description>

				<description>Due to their background, the character has very limited personal experience with the real (physical) world-or they have spent so much time in simulspace that their functioning in real life is impaired. They lack an understanding of many physical properties, social cues, and other factors that people with standard human upbringings take for granted. This lack of common sense may lead the character to misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret someone&apos;s body language. Once per game session, the gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them a description about some thing or some social interaction. This falsehood represents the character&apos;s misunderstanding of the situation and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes the character&apos;s mistake. This trait should only be available to characters with the infolife or re-instantiated backgrounds, though the gamemaster may allow it for characters who have extensive virtual reality/XP use in their personal histories.</description>

When called upon, this patron can pull strings on the character&apos;s behalf, supply resources, introduce them to people they need to know, and bail them out of trouble. The player and gamemaster should work together to define exactly who this NPC is and what their relationship with the player character is. Specifically, the question of why this patron is supporting the character should be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies? the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters should be careful that this trait does not get abused. The patron should be an occasional help (probably no more than once per game session at most) but is not always at the character&apos;s beck-and-call. If the character asks for too much, too often, they should find the patron&apos;s support drying up. Additionally, the character may need to take action to maintain the relationship, such as undertaking a mission on the patron&apos;s behalf.

				<description>The character chooses one type of morph (splicer, neo-hominid, case, etc.). The character always feels right at home in morphs of this type. When resleeving into this type of morph, the character automatically adjusts to the new body, no Integration or Alienation Test needed, suffering no penalties and no mental stress.</description>

				<name>Striking Looks (Level 1)</name>
				<source>Morph</source>
				<description>In an age where biosculpting is easy, good looks are both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however, possesses a physical look that can only be described as striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and fascinating-even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati take notice. On social skill tests where the character&apos;s beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +10 (for Level 1) or +20 (for Level 2) modifier. This modifier is ineffective against xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds. This trait is only available to biomorphs. This modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs, but at half the cost, and it is only effective against characters with that specific uplift background (i.e., neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.). The one drawback to this trait is that the character is more easily noticed and remembered.</description>

The async must enter the downtime for at least 4 hours; every 4 hours of downtime heals 1 point of stress damage. Traumas, derangements, and disorders are unaffected by this sleight. For all sensory purposes, the async is catatonic during downtime, completely oblivious to the outside world. Only severe disturbances or physical shock (such as being wounded or hit by a shock weapon) will bring the async out of it.</description>

If the character succeeds in a COG x 2 Test, they achieve a basic ability to use the object, vehicle, or device, no matter how alien or bizarre. This sleight does not provide any understanding of the principles or technologies involved-the psi user simply grasps how to make it work. If a test is called for, the psi user receives a +20 modifier to use the device (this bonus only applies to unfamiliar devices, and/or tests the character is defaulting on?it does not apply to devices with which the character is familiar).</description>

This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or finding clues hidden among massive amounts of data. The character must have a sufficiently large sample and time enough to study, as determined by the gamemaster. This might range from a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman language to a few days of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens or a week or more of researching a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them spoken. Apply a +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation, Research, or codebreaking Tests (note that this does not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to decrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to more easily learn new languages, reducing the training time by half.</description>

In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve predicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters the async&apos;s decision-making in combat situations by making the best course of action more clear and so provides a +1 bonus to Initiative and +10 to Fray Tests.</description>

				<description>The character possesses an incredible facility with intuitive mathematics. They can do everything from calculate the odds exactly when gambling to predicting precisely where a leaf falling from a tree will land by observing the landscape and local wind currents. The character specializes in calculation involving the activity of complex chaotic systems and so can calculate answers that even the fastest computers could not, including things like patterns of rubble distribution from an explosion. However, this mathematic facility is largely intuitive, so the character does not know the equations they are solving, they merely know the solution to the problem. This sleight also provides a +30 modifier to any skill tests involving math (which the character is calculating, not a computer).</description>

				<description>This sleight allows the async to override their consciousness and let their unconscious mind take point. While in this state, the async&apos;s conscious mind is only dimly aware of what is transgressing, and any memories of this period will be hazy at best. The advantage is that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and so the async&apos;s Speed is boosted by +1. The character remains aware and active, but is incapable of complex communication or other mental actions and is motivated by instinct and primitive urges more than conscious thought. Though it is recommended that the player retain control of their character while using Unconscious Lead, the gamemaster should feel free to direct the character&apos;s actions as they see fit.</description>

The ego finds their body cumbersome, strange, and alien, almost like they are a prisoner within it.

				<description>Deep Scan is a more intrusive version of Thought Browse (p. 228), made to extract information from the targeted individual. If the Opposed Test succeeds, the async telepathically invades the target&apos;s mind and can probe it for information. For every 10 full points of MoS the async achieves on their test, they retrieve one piece of information. Each item takes one full Action Turn to retrieve, during which the sleight must be sustained. The target is aware of this mental probing, though they will not know what information the async acquired.</description>

				<description>This sleight allows the async to stimulate cortical areas of the target&apos;s brain related to emotion. This allows the async to induce, amplify, or tone down specific emotions, thereby manipulating the target. If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they will act in accordance with the emotion for the duration and under certain circumstances may suffer from certain penalties (up to +/?30), as determined by the gamemaster. For example, an async might receive a +30 Intimidation Test modifier against a target imbued with fear.</description>

				<description>Ego Sense can be used to detect the presence and location of other sentient and biological life forms (i.e., egos) within the async&apos;s range. To detect these life forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, opposed by each life form within range. The async may suffer a modifier for detecting small animals and insects, similar to the modifier applied for targeting them in ranged combat (Combat Modifiers table, p. 193); likewise, a modifier for detecting larger life forms may also be applied. If successful, the async detects that the life form is nearby. Every 10 full points of MoS will ascertain another piece of information regarding the detected life: direction from async, approximate size, type of creature, distance from async, etc. The async will know if the target moves, if they do so during the sleight&apos;s duration.</description>

				<name>Implant Memory</name>
				<description>An async using this sleight can implant a memory of up to an hour&apos;s length inside the target&apos;s mind. This memory very obviously does not belong to the target?there is no way they will confuse it for one of their own. The intent is not to fake memories, but to place one of the async&apos;s memories in the target&apos;s mind so that the target can access it just like any other memory. This can be useful for ?archiving? important data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspective, or simply making a ?data dump? for the target to peruse. Implant Memory requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants. At the gamemaster&apos;s discretion, particularly traumatic memories might inflict mental stress on the recipient (p. 214).</description>

If the async&apos;s skill is 61+, the target receives a +20 bonus. Implant Skill requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants.

The async must use this sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test. If successful, the async acquires an ?imprint? of the target&apos;s mind that they can take advantage of when impersonating that ego.

				<description>An async with Omni Awareness is hypersensitive to other biological life that is observing them. During this sleight&apos;s duration, the async makes a Sense Test that is opposed by any life that has focused their attention on them within the sleight&apos;s range; if successful, the async knows they are being watched, but not by whom or what. It does, however, apply a +30 Perception bonus to spot the observer. This sleight does not register partial or fleeting attention, it only notices targets who are actively observing (even if they are concealing their observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a tail, as well as finding potential mates in a bar.</description>

				<description>The async generates an anti-psi jamming field, impeding any use of ranged sleights within their range. All such ranged sleights suffer a ?30 modifier. This sleight has no effect on self or touch-range sleights.</description>

				<name>Subliminal</name>
				<description>The Subliminal sleight allows the async to influence another person by implementing a single post-hypnotic suggestion into the mind of the target. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the recipient will carry out this suggestion as if it was their own idea. Implanted suggestions must be short and simple; the gamemaster may require suggestions be encompassed in a short sentence (for example: ?open the airlock,? or ?hand over the weapon?). The target may receive a bonus for resisting suggestions that are immediately life threatening (?jump off the bridge?) or that violate their motivations or personal strictures. Suggestions may be implanted with a short trigger condition (?when the alarm goes off, ignore it?).</description>

				<name>Thought Browse</name>
				<description>Thought Browse is a less-intrusive form of mind reading that scans the target&apos;s surface thoughts for certain ?keywords? like a particular word, phrase, sound, or image chosen by the async. Rather than digging through the target&apos;s ego as with the Deep Scan sleight, Thought Browse merely verifies whether a target has a particular person, place, event, or thing in mind, which can be used by a savvy investigator to draw conclusions without the need to invade the mind directly. Thought Browse may be sustained, allowing the async to continue scanning the target&apos;s thoughts over time. The async must beat the target in an Opposed Test for each scanned item.</description>
